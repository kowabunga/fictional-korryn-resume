          Hi, I'm Korryn Kazeway. Born in the great state of New York. As a child I remember my father bringing me in to work for the standard
          <strong><em>bring your daughter to work day</em></strong> and spent the whole day watching him type away on his computer. Not really knowing what he was doing, he showed me how he could type
          things on the computer and make it do stuff. From that point on I can remember always wanting to become a software developer. As such, once I graduated high school it was an easy choice as
          to what I was doing in college.
          <br />
          This website was built by me (yay!) as a resume to show off some of the projects that I am most proud of. You'll also find a way to contact me at the bottom of this page.

          <h3>Blog Page</h3>
          <p>
            This project started out as a simple blog page to learn how to use CSS Grid and make it responsive at various screen sizes. I also had a chance to play around with using Sass to write my
            CSS for it, as it makes it much cleaner when writing <em>and</em> adds rules that I had not considered (rules such as -ms- and -webkit- for older browsers).

          <h3>Blog Administrator Page</h3>
          <p>
            This project is an expansion of the Blog Page project I mentioned previously. Having had a look at Bootstrap, I thought it would be good to learn how to make a more complex webpage in a
            simpler manner. Bootstrap enables the creation of complex webpages without the hassle that comes with having to manually decide everything with pure CSS.

          <h3>Making Meals</h3>
          <p>
            This restaurant website was made as an experiment into adding JavaScript and JQuery to a typical HTML/CSS website I created earlier on in my learning experience. I had a lot of fun doing
            this, though it could be frustrating at times when the scripts wouldn't do as I expected, though eventually I figured them out.
